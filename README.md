# Amazon-Clone
Welcome to the Amazon Clone Repository! This project is a static web-based clone of Amazon's e-commerce platform, built using only HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to replicate the visual design and layout of the Amazon website to practice front-end development skills without involving JavaScript or server-side technologies.
